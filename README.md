## About

Mystic Woods is an example project for a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe02AjMmzRwrChKaQ7mkv8g)
that will teach you some recipes about how to create your own 2D adventure game using
[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) and [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

It uses [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) as a physic system for collision handling and movement. It
also uses [Gdx-AI](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai) for player states and enemy slime AI.

The controls are:
- Arrows keys to move around
- Space to attack which is also used to interact with chests
